A visit to the stunning natural reserve in the Cocora Valley was the reason we came to Salento, but we found much, much more to love.<br><br>

At first, we were planning a 2 day excursion into the nearby Los Nevados national park, but the high altitude, long distance and the requirement to hire a guide for the park made us reconsider, and we explored only the Cocora Valley, located at the foot of the national park. An exciting jeep ride from the town later, we found ourselves in a stunning cloud forest, crossing streams on rickety bridges, wading along rivers and feeling like explorers. In the valley, we stopped at a hummingbird sanctuary, and then ascended to the highest point in the valley for what would have been a stunning view, if not for the thick clouds. The valley is famous for its wax palms, the protected national tree of Colombia, which grows up to 60 meters or more.

The town of Salento lies in the heart of the Zona Cafetera, with many fincas dotted around the nearby hills, producing high quality coffee. A tour of one of these farms taught us about the ecological coffee production. We also attempted to cycle in these hills, but realized only after a fast, fun descend into the valley below that we'd have a long and gruelling ride back up awaiting us. Coming up was definitely not as fun as going down...

We enjoyed our time in Salento very much, and after a few days we caught a ride to the town of San Agustin, famous for its archaeological park with prehispanic carved stone statues. A small museum at the entrance about the local culture that produced these statues provided valuable context for the visit to the archaeological sites in the park, and some carvings can even still be seen in the country side around the village, overlooking the Magdalena river.

We spent almost a week in San Agustin, mostly relaxing and preparing for the long bus ride ahead into Ecuador and the town of Otavalo.
