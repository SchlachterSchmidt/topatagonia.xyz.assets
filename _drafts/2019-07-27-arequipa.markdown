18 hour bus ride and we're in what turned out to be our favourite place in Peru yet!<br><br>


Arequipa is the second largest city of Peru with a bit less than a million inhabitants (quite a jump from 10 million in Lima). It's called the White City because most of its architecture is build of sillar - a light volcanic stone. Apart from wandering around the town and soaking in its freshness and charm we've found an amazing cafe where Phil did two courses: one on brewing coffee and the other one on types of espressos. Money well spent - when we go back to Europe I'm sure you can test his new skill. :)

Sitting at the base of five volcanos Arequipa spoiled us with gorgeous sunsets. There is something about Peru and its blue and yellow and orange and pink evenings. It's definitely going to stay with us forever.

And now.. the second deepest canyon in the world is calling. We're on our way, Colca!
