...back to nature again!<br><br>


With an astonishing depth of 3270 metres Colca canyon is the second deepest canyon in the world. So we decided to hike it - Annette at first was a bit lazy and a thought of taking a tour but ultimately, and as most of the times, the adventure won. 

The hike was very difficult, definitely more difficult then we expected. We crossed the canyon twice (!) - all the way to the bottom and then up. In total, we must have hiked about 20 km and we changed altitude a lot: first day 700m down, second day 700m up and 700m down again, third day over a 1000m up. We were leaving very early each day to avoid the burning sun. The canyon is partially a desert so the heat close to midday became unbearable a few times... which resulted in one of us experiencing a breakdown wanting to turn back even though there was absolutely no way it was possible at that stage (let's not be pointing fingers but well... it was Annette :P ). 

During the hike we stayed in basic places without electricity - one of them was an oasis in the middle of scorching hot mountains and deserts. A waterfall brought life to a place that would otherwise be absolutely uninhabitable. It was a much needed and very relaxing time with a lot of card playing, jenga and star gazing. The sky in the canyon is so clear we even got to see the Milky Way - it was INCREDIBLE!

We're happy we hiked instead of taking the tour. Even though it was crazy difficult, we would do it again this way. We got to spend time on our own, without a soul around, star gazing, hiking and reading. Can this be any better?

After a long bus ride (and seeing a volcano erupt!) we got back to Arequipa. It's time for Cusco and Machu Picchu...
