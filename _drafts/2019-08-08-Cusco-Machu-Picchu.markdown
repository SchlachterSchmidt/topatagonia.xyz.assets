We arrived in Cusco which means Machu Picchu is just a few days away!!! <br><br>


With all the excitement we will keep it short. Cusco is a gorgeous town at 3400 m asl which was the main Inca town back in the 15th century. It's a shocking melt of Incan and Hispanic culture, you walk down the street and can almost breathe in the importance of this place to both Incas and then the Spaniards.

It took us two days to get to Machu Picchu from Cusco. It is the most impressive historic site we've both seen in our lifetimes (we might have exaggerated with our 'mosts' before but this one truly is) and we both agreed the ticket rip off price (60 dollars per person if you're lucky) is totally worth it. We skipped the expensive train and instead took a loooong bus ride followed by a 3 hour long trek. It was worth it. It left us speechless. 

After over a month in Peru it's time to part our ways very very soon...
