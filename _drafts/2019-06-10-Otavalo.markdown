Ecuador, at last. <br><br>

Crossing the border into Ecuador was largely uneventful, except for the staggering amount of Venezuelans leaving their home country. We've spoken to a few Venezuelans over the past few weeks, but here at the border the scale of the humanitarian crisis became very apparent. Separate queues for Venezuelan refugees, Red Cross tents, and medical aid stations were just some of the heartbreaking sights.

We continued on to Otavalo, home to the largest indigenous community in Ecuador, where people dressed in the traditional style and wearing traditional clothing are a common sight. Otavalo lies at the foot of two volcanoes, Imbabura and Cotacachi, and close to the Laguna de Cuicocha (Guinea Pig Lake). We didn't scale any mountains but hiked around the lake, visited the nearby Peguche waterfall and Condor sanctuary with many species of birds of prey rescued from all over south america. The most impressive sight though was the sacred El Lechero tree, which legend says is 1000 years old. Ritual offerings of corn, fruit, beans and even guinea pigs are laid around the tree during rituals of harvest, marriage, birth and death. 

Otavalo has a special atmosphere, where traditions and family are extremely important, and the time we spent here was a great way to experience ecuadorian culture before moving on to the metropolitan capital Quito.
